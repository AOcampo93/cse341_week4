## CSE341 WEEK 04 - REST Documentation using Swagger

This project is a Node.js and Express-based RESTful API that connects to a MongoDB database to manage a collection of contacts.
The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) contact records stored in the database. Each contact includes basic personal information such as first name, last name, email, favorite color, and birthday.

To make the API easy to understand and test, it is fully documented using Swagger.
Through the interactive Swagger UI available at the /api-docs route, users can visually explore all available endpoints, view request and response structures, and even execute live API calls directly from the browserâ€”without the need for external tools like Postman.

The project was deployed to Render, ensuring that the API and its Swagger documentation are accessible online over HTTPS.
